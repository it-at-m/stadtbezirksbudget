# ADR-05 Use-Test-Method-Prefix

## Context

The code should have a certain uniformity. This also applies to the tests.

## Decision

All test methods start with the prefix `test`.

Corresponding to lowerCamelCase, the method name continues afterward with an uppercase letter.

## Consequences

Other than code uniformity and a slightly longer method name, no implications are noticeable.
