# ADR-03 Use-Test-File-Suffix

## Context

The code should have a certain uniformity. This also applies to the test files (frontend and backend).

## Decision

All test files and class names in the backend end with the suffix `Test`.
All test files in the frontend end with the suffix `.test` (instead of .spec).

## Consequences

Other than code uniformity and a slightly longer class name, no implications are noticeable.
