# Architecture Design Records (ADRs)

Architecture Decision Records (ADR) are documented architectural decisions, each of which clarifies specific coding rules and guidelines that collectively shape
our codebase.

## Purpose of ADRs

ADRs serve as a living record of important technical decisions made throughout the project. They help teams understand the rationale behind architectural
choices, ensure consistency, and support onboarding of new developers. By documenting the context, decision, and consequences, ADRs make it easier to revisit
and adapt decisions as requirements evolve.

Each ADR follows a standardized template to ensure clarity and comparability. The template can be found in [ADR-00 Is-Template](./adr/00-is-template). New ADRs
should be added whenever a significant architectural or coding decision is made, and existing ADRs should be updated if decisions change.
